# UnWave-Net
**UnWave-Net: Unrolled Wavelet Network for Compton Tomography Image Reconstruction**

This repository contains the official PyTorch implementation of the paper _UnWave-Net: Unrolled Wavelet Network for Compton Tomography Image Reconstruction_, presented at **MICCAI 2024**.

## üßê Overview
UnWave-Net is designed for image reconstruction in Compton tomography, utilizing unrolled optimization techniques in combination with wavelet transforms. The model excels at reconstructing images with reduced noise by incorporating a wavelet-based regularization term.

## üíæ Dataset
The UnWave-Net model has been trained and evaluated using the [AAPM Compton Scattering Tomography Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ishak21/aapm-cst). This dataset is essential for benchmarking the performance of Compton tomography reconstruction techniques.

### Dataset Information

## Usage
To use the dataset with UnWave-Net, follow these steps:
#### Clone this github repo and install its requirements:
**1.** Clone this repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Ishak96/UnWave-Net.git
cd UnWave-Net
```
**2.** Mamba installation
If you don't have Conda installed, you can either install it manually or opt for Mamba, which is faster. 

To install Mamba, follow this link to Mambaforge. Below are the latest installers with Mamba in the base environment:
